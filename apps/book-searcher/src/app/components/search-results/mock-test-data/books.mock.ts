In the pages that follow we are drawn into a deeply committed Dharma life lived in unusual circumstances and among some very colourful characters. As he recalls the significant events of those years - the setting up of the Kalimpong Young Men's Buddhist Association; the creation of a new Buddhist journal, whose contributors included Conze, Guenther, Govinda and other leading Buddhist writers of the time; accompanying the Sacred Relics of the Buddha's chief disciples; advising on the making of a Buddhist film; giving lectures; discovering Dharmapala; meeting Dhardo Rimpoche; in fact, working in every way to spread the Dharma - Sangharakshita also affords the reader glimpses of his inner life, his struggles and disappointments, his aspirations and inspirations, his responses to the beauties of nature, and his feeling for friendship.The twenty-nine letters collected together in Dear Dinoo span the period 1955-1974, giving a sighting of Sangharakshita's life as he experienced it at the time, including what happened on the day of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's untimely death in 1956. We are also afforded a glimpse of the unusual friendship that sprung up between the young English monk and the Montessori teacher. Kalyanaprabha's Introduction highlights some of the significances of the correspondence, including reflections on Sangharakshita, Women, and Friendship. A friend who often appears in the letters, Dr Dinshaw Mehta, Servant of God, and one time naturopath to Gandhi, is the subject of the appendix.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781911407171"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1911407171"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":672,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.es/books?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT770&dq=dinooo&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"ES","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":16.5,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":15.68,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-LOpdDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":16500000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":15680000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"ES","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.es/books/download/Facing_Mount_Kanchenjunga-sample-epub.acsm?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.es/books/download/Facing_Mount_Kanchenjunga-sample-pdf.acsm?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LOpdDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The two Parsi girls are mentioned in <b>Dinoo&#39;s</b> letter of 28 November and were due <br>\nto take up residence with <b>Dinoo</b> as teachers in her school. &#39;I had such a strong <br>\nurge to leave everything and go and settle down in Kalimpong,&#39; <b>Dinoo</b> had written<br>\n&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"YfTsxQEACAAJ","etag":"O+c4Zu/Rmfs","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YfTsxQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Stray Thoughts on the War","authors":["Dinoo S Bastavala"],"publishedDate":"2013","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"OCLC:1089917572"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.es/books?id=YfTsxQEACAAJ&dq=dinooo&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.es/books?id=YfTsxQEACAAJ&dq=dinooo&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Stray_Thoughts_on_the_War.html?hl=&id=YfTsxQEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"ES","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"ES","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YfTsxQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"M545dmAi4LIC","etag":"v/H5h4RfYDU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/M545dmAi4LIC","volumeInfo":{"title":"XI Censo general de población y vivienda, 1990","subtitle":"resultados definitivos; tabulados básicos.

They were fresh recruits to be trained by Dad. Their sole ambition was to migrate to London for most Brits were heading home as the Empire’s rule was about to end. And the matrimonial route was not ruled out possibly via Col Browns toothy daughters! It was a period of migrations – the Muslims to a new nation being carved out for them, sometimes leaving behind loved and unloved ones; the white man to his homeland, not without trepidation at the impending loss of luxury and an influx of refugees to various parts of India, armed with their grit and dreams to succeed again. In all this melee, Deolali Days has a lot of comic characters who willy-nilly get involved with each other. To top it all, a dazzling yet intimidating woman entrepreneur, seemingly from a royal background, is ready to seize the moment. But adding the most colour is Poppat baba, a parrot whose predictions are mysteriously correct to the dot, driving the heroes nuts! Who is who in this utter chaotic confusion? What happens to them? Deolali Days is a bubbling narrative of those magical times.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781645879534"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1645879534"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":272,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.es/books?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT103&dq=dinooo&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"ES","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":3.25,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":3.09,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xH6hDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":3250000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":3090000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"ES","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xH6hDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"As though to re-ascertain the facts and at each sentence, <b>Dinoo</b>, with her dimpled <br>\nsmile, kept answering, “Yes.
